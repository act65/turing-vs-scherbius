Core
- add the option to use a reflector?
- reset the engima steps every round
- change to be a finite deck of cards
- change game_state.step to be functional!
- support alternative card values (not ints - tho the ints will just be categories now). (base on symmetries? with many cycles)

RL
- mcts. can share value fn between scherbius and turing
- autoregressive transformer for generating card allocations
    - order of cards in hand doesnt matter.
    - inputs: rewards, scherbius' plays (if Turning policy), allocations so far, current hand.
- (will need to optimise the core for speed?)

Site
- display config variables at top
- add tests
- need to guarantee the order of which cards Scherbius encrypts first?
- only allow reencryption if VP > pts required.

meta search
- we want to game to require; turing to actually codebreak, scherbius to model likelihoods and sometimes reset the encryption,
